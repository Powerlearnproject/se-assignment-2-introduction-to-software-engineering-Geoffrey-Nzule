Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

It is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications.


What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Software engineering is basically a branch of computer science which deals with testing, maintenance and deployment of software applications. Traditional programming in the other hand is based on building software functions, systems and applications. Programmers use their existing computer language to update resent programs as well as build new ones.  There are some variations between software engineer and traditional programmer. A software developer designs every aspect of system or application and how they will merge together.  Software engineer manages software development. Additionally, software engineer collaborates with team members and relevant stakeholders. In conclusion, software engineers development life cycle (SDLC) include improvements and updates of software.   In contrast, programmer writes code to specification, they also carry out programing of software development process and they are mainly involved in testing, programming and debugging. Similarly, both software engineers and programmers write, test and debug code. Nevertheless, developers are more involved in the life cycle of software development on how the interface look and interact with the users. They also manage updates, maintenance and addition of new versions, features and functions.


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Life cycle of a software development ensures that the software is cost-effective, quality and time efficiency. The process involves a detailed guide that breaks down development process into segments that can be assigned, completed and manageable in measurable output 
Agile and waterfall model frameworks helps in arranging different development process in an organized way. The Agile model framework methodology is termed as highly effective in identifying issue early but it is overreliance on customer feedback (11 & Raza, 2020). The model is guided by outlined manifesto in collaborations, working software and responding to change. On the other hand, Waterfall model is dependent on the outcome of the previous phase’s thus minimal room for change once a phase is completed. This model divides software development into distinct phases with specified deliverables.


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

Common similarities between Agile and Waterfall project management include; 
-	They share same goal oriented approaches to meet or exceed customer expectations in terms of scope constraints, cost and time.
-	Despite the differences between Agile and Waterfall they have similarities in designing, testing, planning development and deployment.
-	Both Agile and Waterfall requires documentation at different stages of development.
-	Stakeholders in both methodologies require involvement in project planning and gathering required needs as expected.
-	Quality focus from both Agile and Waterfall methodologies through integration and testing in aim to deliver final product quality standards without defects. 
-	Project management tool such as Gantt chart, Kanban boards are used by both methodologies to track progress.
Differences between Agile and Waterfall methodologies include;
-	Agile uses lterative and incremental while Waterfall use sequential and linear approach.
-	Agile incorporate flexible and adaptive methodology while Waterfall process is documented following a fixed structure form the beginning of the process.
-	Agile has feedback-based approach while Waterfall has limited and delayed feedback.
-	Agile follows a mindset of communication and collaboration while Waterfall follows project-focused with the aim of completing SDLC process.
-	Agile responsibilities and hierarchical structure can be changed between members while Waterfall has fixed individual responsibilities in a specified management position.
-	Agile is suitable for short projects during high risk situation as compared to Waterfall which is straight forward with predicable projects.
In conclusion, Agile and Waterfall methodologies have various advantages over each other in specified scenarios. For instance, Waterfall may be considered if there is no limited access to the consumer to provide constant feedback (Trunkett, 2021). It suits best with a dispersed team, budget and fixed scope. In the other, Agile is more suitable in a large and more complex access with easy access to customer feedback.


What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Requirement Engineering is the process of analyzing, identifying, eliciting, specifying, managing and validating the needs and expectations of stakeholders in software engineering system. .  There are various examples of phases of software development life cycle; 
-	Planning & analysis- it is the first crucial for laying project framework where the stakeholders discuss the project’s scope, objective and requirements.
-	Design- software design architecture is initiated with directives of how the structure and components will react with the external system. 
-	Implementation-in this stage, the developers use the design document to code using chosen programming language thus ensuring coding standards , version control and code reviews.
-	Testing-during the testing stage, the developer examine to find and correct any problems.
-	Deployment- in the deployment stage is where the end users can have access to the final product.
-	Maintenance-the last stage is the maintenance stage where regular updates are done, adding new features and fixing existing bugs. 


Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Modularity in software design is basically dividing software into separate and independent modules which are each responsible for a distinct functionality or feature. Ways in which the modularity approach improves or better software systems is through scalability, maintainability and reusability of the code by making complex systems easier, isolating functional boundaries which are easy to manage and evolve.  In maintainability, changes in a single model does not affect the other thus making it easier to track and fix bugs without affecting other sections of the system. In the other hand, scalability typically entails adding new models or upgrading existing ones without affecting the system. 

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

Software testing is the process of executing in order to find an error. The process ensures that the program is error free through evaluation on the requirement system specifications and users. Levels of software testing includes; 

-	Unit testing-the codes are usually written in same programming language as the software and uses a testing library or framework to verify its functionality.

-	Integration testing –incorporate individual unit or software application components combined and tested as group. The output process ensures interaction between units or components function correctly.

-	System testing-entire software system is tested to ensure that it meets requirements and specification it was designed to execute.

-	Acceptance testing-is the final phase of testing before releasing software product to the end user.
It is crucial to conduct testing in software development to ensure quality assurance, risk mitigation, customer satisfaction, it’s cost effective, compliance and meets standards.


What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

The system is a set of software tools that allow the software team to manage source code changes easily. It keeps track of all changes made to a file so that a specific version can be restored if needed in the future.  It is important because of Keeping track of all changes made to a file. It is crucial because it allows for a specific version to be restored if needed in the future. Some examples of version control systems include;

Git- It is known as a distributed version control system (DVCS) that is designed to efficiently handle projects of all sizes, from small to very large. It enables multiple developers to collaborate on a project at the same time without interfering with each other's work. Additionally, it keeps a record of all changes made for collaboration and auditing purposes. Some of its key features include distributed version control, branching and merging, staging area, commit history among others.

GitHub- This platform is based on Git for version control and collaboration. It offers a user-friendly interface and extra features to help manage repositories, encourage collaboration, and simplify the development process. Key features include; repositories, code reviews, issues and bug tracking, wiki, project management among others.


Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Project manager plays a crucial role in the success of the project by overseeing all aspects of the development process and ensuring that it is completed on time and within budget. They must possess strong leadership skills, excellent communication abilities, and a keen attention to detail in order to effectively manage all aspects of the project .To ensure the successful delivery of a high-quality software product by a project manager can be achieved through strategic organization, proactive planning, and adaptability. By employing this approach, project managers can effectively navigate challenges, ensuring that stakeholders' needs and expectations are consistently met.
Some of the key responsibilities of a project manager include;

-	Presenting new project ideas and proposals to clients, colleagues, and stakeholders for feedback.
-	Organizing programs, establishing boundaries and establishing timelines.
-	Building project teams and distributing duties.
-	Monitoring achievements and performance indicators.


Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

Software maintenance involves ensuring that the software being utilized and functioning optimally. This includes identifying and rectifying errors promptly, and ensuring seamless operation.  Different maintenance activities in development include;

-	Corrective- Corrective maintenance is focused on identifying and rectifying any lingering errors, regardless of their origin in specifications, design, coding, testing, documentation, or other areas. This process is essential for ensuring the overall quality and functionality of a system or product. 

-	Preventative-it is the process of preventing our system from becoming outdated. This involves reengineering and reverse engineering, where an old system with outdated technology is updated using new technology.

-	Perfective- improves performance and efficiency thus enhancing changerability.

-	Adaptive - Adapting the software to reflect adjustments in the ever-shifting environment is essential.

The reason why maintenance is important is correct deployment errors, keep system operational and also run systems operationa (Watters, 2024)l. It's also important to plan ahead, make sure there are enough people to do the work, and make sure everything lines up with the goals of the organization. The maintenance phase lasts for several years, making optimized life cycle management essential for ensuring the long-term success of the software.


What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Software engineering challenges typically involve finding a balance between the needs of different parties, upholding professional standards, and ensuring that the impact of their work on society is beneficial. For instance, those challenges include; privacy and protection, security, algorithmic bias and fairness, proessional integrity, compliance and legal issues among others.
There are ways a software engineer can adhere to ethical standards including; following professional codes of ethics, prioritizing security and policy, promoting accountability and transparency, promoting social responsibilities among others.
